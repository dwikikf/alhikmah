          Alternative proteins are proteins produced from plants, microbes, or
          cultivated animal cells. These innovative foods are designed to taste
          the same as or better than conventional animal products, while costing
          the same or less. Plant-based meat (PBM) combines plant-based
          proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals to deliver the tastes and
          flavours consumers expect from the animal meat they know and love.
          Cultivated meat (CM) involves directly harvesting cells from farmed
          animals and growing them in bioreactors similar to those used to brew
          beer. The cells undergo similar biological processes to what occurs in
          an animal, allowing producers to grow genuine animal tissue more
          safely and securely. Fermentation-derived (FD) proteins come in
          several forms. Precision fermentation can create standalone functional
          ingredients by engineering microorganisms to express specific proteins
          or fats. Similarly, biomass fermentation leverages the exponential
          growth of microbes to create delicious, animal-free meats.
